# Automated-Email-Management-System

This is a small Project which is usually used to create an automated e-mail reminder for HRs & Managers before a new employee's probation period confirmation date.

I have used Python to implement this project. confirmation_email.py file is the main file here and inside that code all the required methods are written. Confirmation_tracker.xls is the excel file which contains the all employee data along with their emails, manager name, manager email, HR name, HR's email, joining date and the confirmation date calculated with respect to the joining date etc. Logo.jsp is nothing but look enhancement & also it can be use as an attachment.

To Run The Code:
1. Install puthon into your system.
2. open CMD on the same location where the code saved/downloaded.
3. execute: python confirmation_email.py

And Boom! you are done.

Since this application creates an infinite loop, Incase of closing the application you can simply press ctrl + c.

Thank you!
